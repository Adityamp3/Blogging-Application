        <h2>How AI is Going to Change the World</h2>
        <p>
          Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to transform numerous
          industries and aspects of our daily lives. From healthcare to finance,
          AI's ability to analyze large sets of data and make predictions is
          driving innovation and efficiency. In healthcare, AI is being used to
          predict patient outcomes, personalize treatment plans, and even assist
          in surgery. Financial institutions are leveraging AI to detect fraud,
          manage risk, and provide personalized financial advice. According to
          reports by McKinsey and PwC, AI could potentially add $13 trillion to
          the global economy by 2030. Research in AI continues to advance, with
          significant developments in machine learning, natural language
          processing, and robotics. As AI technology evolves, it will create new
          opportunities and challenges, requiring a thoughtful approach to its
          implementation and governance.
        </p>
        <br /><br />

        <h2>How can I use AI?</h2>

        <p>
          AI comes in different forms and has become widely available in
          everyday life. The smart speakers on your mantle with Alexa or Google
          voice assistant built-in are two great examples of AI. Other good
          examples include popular AI chatbots, such as ChatGPT, the new Bing
          Chat, and Google Bard. When you ask ChatGPT for the capital of a
          country, or you ask Alexa to give you an update on the weather, the
          responses come from machine-learning algorithms. Also: How does
          ChatGPT work? Though these systems aren't a replacement for human
          intelligence or social interaction, they can use their training to
          adapt and learn new skills for tasks they weren't explicitly
          programmed to perform.
        </p>
        <br /><br />

        <h2>What are some recent examples of AI?</h2>
        <p>
          Overall, the most notable advancements in AI are the development and
          release of GPT 3.5 and GPT 4. But there have been many other
          revolutionary achievements in artificial intelligence -- too many to
          include here. Here are some of the most notable: ChatGPT (and the
          GPTs) ChatGPT is an AI chatbot capable of generating and translating
          natural language and answering questions. Though it's arguably the
          most popular AI tool, thanks to its widespread accessibility, OpenAI
          made significant waves in artificial intelligence by creating GPTs 1,
          2, and 3 before releasing ChatGPT. <br />
          Also: 5 ways to use chatbots to make your life easier GPT stands for
          Generative Pre-trained Transformer, and GPT-3 was the largest language
          model at its 2020 launch, with 175 billion parameters. Then came
          GPT-3.5, which powers the free tier of ChatGPT. The largest version,
          GPT-4, accessible through ChatGPT Plus or Microsoft Copilot, has one
          trillion parameters. Self-driving cars Though the safety of
          self-driving cars is a top concern of potential users, the technology
          continues to advance and improve with breakthroughs in AI. These
          vehicles use machine-learning algorithms to combine data from sensors
          and cameras to perceive their surroundings and determine the best
          course of action. Also: An autonomous car that wakes up and greets you
          could be in your future Tesla's autopilot feature in its electric
          vehicles is probably what most people think of when considering
          self-driving cars. Still, Waymo, from Google's parent company,
          Alphabet, makes autonomous rides, like a taxi without a taxi driver,
          in San Francisco, CA, and Phoenix, AZ. Cruise is another robotaxi
          service, and auto companies like Audi, GM, and Ford are also
          presumably working on self-driving vehicle technology. Robotics The
          achievements of Boston Dynamics stand out in the area of AI and
          robotics. Though we're still a long way away from creating AI at the
          level of technology seen in the movie Terminator, watching Boston
          Dyanmics' robots use AI to navigate and respond to different terrains
          is impressive. DeepMind Google's sister company DeepMind is an AI
          pioneer making strides toward the ultimate goal of artificial general
          intelligence (AGI). Though not there yet, the company initially made
          headlines in 2016 with AlphaGo, a system that beat a human
          professional Go player. Since then, DeepMind has created a
          protein-folding prediction system that can predict the complex 3D
          shapes of proteins. It has also developed programs to diagnose eye
          diseases as effectively as the top doctors worldwide.
